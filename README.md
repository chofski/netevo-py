NetEvo for Python
=================

NetEvo is a computing framework designed to allow researchers to investigate evolutionary aspects of dynamical complex networks. By providing tools to easily integrate each of these factors in a coherent way, it is hoped a greater understanding can be gained of key attributes and features displayed by complex systems.

This branch is a port to Python and uses networkx as the underlying datatype. This allows for an interactive and flexible system that is ideal for small to medium sized networks and teaching.
