NetEvo for Python
=================

NetEvo is a computing framework designed to allow researchers to investigate evolutionary aspects of dynamical complex networks. It provides functionality to easily simulate dynamical networks with both nodes and edges states, and includes optimization methods to evolve the dynamics or structure of a system towards some user specified goal.
    
NetEvo is writen in Python and makes use of the networkx, numpy, and SciPy packages.
